# ansible-home

**June 2020 by chris@leygraf.de**

This is a basic collection of ansible playbooks to setup my personal Windows systems. It's a subset of the playbooks I use for my professional work.

In addition I utilize [Boxstarter](https://boxstarter.org/) together with a simple [gist](https://gist.github.com/cleygraf/907574188e60eb6a1c2a7047b241080c) to speedup the initial install.
